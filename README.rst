pifi provides a command line wrapper for iwlist and /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
that makes it easier to connect the WiFi networks from the command line, specifically on a
a Raspberry Pi Device. The pifi command is also implemented as a library that can be used from Python.

::

    # pip install pifi
    # pifi --help
